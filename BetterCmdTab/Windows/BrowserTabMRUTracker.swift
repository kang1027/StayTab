/// Unified most-recently-used ordering that treats each **browser tab** as a
/// first-class entry alongside ordinary windows, backing the experimental
/// "browser tab MRU" mode (#39). The flat `.mruWindows` sort keys every row by
/// its CGWindowID, so all tabs of one browser window collapse to a single
/// recency slot and ⌘Tab can only return to the previous *window*, never the
/// previous *tab*. This tracker distinguishes the two:
///
/// - `.window(wid)` — an ordinary window (or a browser window whose tabs aren't
///   expanded), keyed by its CGWindowID, exactly like `WindowMRUTracker`.
/// - `.tab(wid, title)` — one browser tab. Tabs share their parent window's
///   CGWindowID, so the active tab's title is the only cheap per-tab identity we
///   have (read straight off the window's AX title — no Apple Events). Title
///   churn on navigation just renames the entry the user is already on, which is
///   harmless: it still points at "the tab they're looking at".
///   The AX title an entry records is not always the tab title a displayed row
///   carries: Chromium suffixes the window title with the browser (and profile)
///   name, so `sortRows` matches those through
///   `BrowserTabs.windowTitle(_:matchesTab:)` (#157).
///
/// Fed by `BrowserTabFocusObserver` (in-browser tab switches) and the switcher's
/// focus/commit paths. Pure ordering — no AX/Apple Events here, so it's unit
/// testable. Dead ids/titles never match a live row, so stale entries are
/// harmless; the cap is the only cleanup needed.
